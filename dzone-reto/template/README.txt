- If the gamemode crash when the warmup is over and you start dropping 
then you need more point_dz_weaponspawn. There's 500+ on BlackSite, 
some says 230 is the minimum, some says it's 82

- materials\models\weapons\v_models\tablet\tablet_radar_%MAPNAME%.vtf
is the map that displays on the tablet. Alpha is height

- materials\panorama\images\survival\spawnselect\map_%MAPNAME%.png
is the map displayed when you select where you drop in the UI

- maps\%MAPNAME%_spawnmask.png
sets what spawns are valid

- The rest is basic mapping.

- Have fun!
