Follow this text guide if AutoRadar_installer.exe fails to install everything correctly
Try using install_override.bat first. You may need to edit the path to match your counter strike bin folder folder.

# Copyfiles:
	1) Copy everything in /bin_content/ to your csgo installation's /bin/ folder
	2) Copy everything in /hammer_content/ to your csgo installation's /csgo/ folder
	3) Create a directory in your csgo installation's global offensive/bin/ folder named 'tar'
	4) Copy everything in /AutoRadar2.0.4/ to your csgo installation's global offensive/bin/tar/ folder

# Command Sequences:
	1) Add a new compile profile in the expert compile mode
	2) Set its name to [TAR] Generate Radar
	3) Set the executable to: $exedir/bin/tar/AutoRadar.exe
	4) Set the args to: -g $gamedir $path/$file

# FGD:

Done :)
